- the advantage that smart pointer syntax provides. Use example from your code to support your explanation.

For smart pointer when you call new you don't have to delete, in some cases you don't even need to call new, in this workshop the operator+= for the smart pointer one, I used unique_ptr that is when that pointer goes out of the scope and it will get destroy, so for the mergeSmart there is no need to call delete.



- the difference between raw and smart pointer syntax in your solution.

  So for mergeSmart compare to mergeRaw, they look almost the same, but when I allocate memory for smartPointer, I used unique_ptr to allocate it, it will delete the memory by itself, but raw pointer won't, so we need to delete by ourselves.
