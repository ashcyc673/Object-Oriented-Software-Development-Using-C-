I learned a few new object types, to record the times and convert it to the right format.
When I finished the workshop, I tried to compile and run it but it's super slow, can't even run actually, so I looked up online,
to see is there any other way to make my program run faster, there are two library functions for reading the text file faster,
which is vector and mmap, but mmap is for like super big files.  Our text file is big but no need to use mmap yet,
so I tried vector, and looks more beginner friendly, and it did change my program performance, runs way faster than before.

In vector there is a internal function called resize, to use push_back function to add new element into the array.  It will only
allocate the new memory for the new element need to be added to the dynamic array, for all the old data will simply copy the address of old data
not allocate memory and deep copy for those old data.  And vector will deallocate the memory automatically so we don't need to
do it manually that's why program can run faster.

For the move constructor and move operator only copy from the address, change the address of current to the new object,
so it's more efficiency to run the program, on the other hand copy constructor is going to copy the whole value to the current
object, then it needs to allocate the memory at first, and copy the old value to the new one, so it takes more time, will slow down the
performance.
